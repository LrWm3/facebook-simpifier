# Facebook Simplifier plugin

An extension of the [Facebook ad-free lifestyle](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/387353-facebook-ad-free-lifestyle/code) script produced by BanditCat.

## Overview

This extension eliminates sponsored stories. It then collapses all stories. Stories can be expanded by clicking on the text. This provides more control to the viewer on what they want to actually see.

Probably doesn't work on mobile.

## Example

![Collapsed Stories](docs/res/example-of-collapsed-stories.png)

This shows what stories look like when collapsed.

Clicking on any collapsed story will show the full story.
